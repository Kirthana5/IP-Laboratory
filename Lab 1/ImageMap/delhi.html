            Delhi, India’s capital territory, is a massive metropolitan area in the country’s north.
In Old Delhi, a neighborhood dating to the 1600s, stands the imposing Mughal-era Red Fort, 
a symbol of India, and the sprawling Jama Masjid mosque, whose courtyard accommodates 
25,000 people. Nearby is Chandni Chowk, a vibrant bazaar filled with food carts, sweets 
shops and spice stalls.
