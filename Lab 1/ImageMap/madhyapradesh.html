            Madhya Pradesh, a large state in central India, retains landmarks from eras throughout Indian history.
Begun in the 10th century, its Hindu and Jain temples at Khajuraho are renowned for their carvings of 
erotic scenes, most prominently Kandariya Mahadeva, a temple with more than 800 sculptures.
The eastern Bandhavgarh and Kanha national parks, noted Bengal tiger sanctuaries, offer guided safaris.
